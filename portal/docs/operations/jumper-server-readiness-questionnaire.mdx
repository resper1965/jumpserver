# LVHN Jumper Server Readiness Questionnaire

**Document Control**
- **Version:** 1.1 (Lean)
- **Date:** 2025-11-11
- **Classification:** Internal – Discovery Document
- **Purpose:** Collect only the data required to confirm that the LVHN-managed jumper server can support Ionic Health eKVM patching.
- **Return To:** Ionic Health Project Manager (email)

---

> **Configuration Custody Notice**  
> Ionic Health engineering exclusively manages all eKVM configuration, firmware, and software changes, including patch execution via the jumper server. LVHN operations is responsible for provisioning, hardening, and maintaining the Windows jumper server environment. Cross-domain actions require written approval from both teams.

> **Network Visibility Scope**  
> This questionnaire limits discovery to the LVHN-operated jumper server and its outbound connectivity toward Ionic-managed eKVM devices; no additional network details are required.

---

## Instructions

- Please complete only the fields marked **Required**. Optional items help contextualize operations but are not mandatory.
- The questionnaire focuses on the jumper server path; Ionic-owned eKVM devices remain external to LVHN’s managed network and are reached via public IP over the maintenance window.
- Return the completed form by email or the agreed secure channel.
